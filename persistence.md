## TODO
Following warning is shown:

	Using the default Java serializer for class [...] which is not recommended because of 
	performance implications. Use another serializer or disable this warning using the 
	setting 'akka.actor.warn-about-java-serializer-usage'
	
It does not cause any problems but still will be nice to fix.
